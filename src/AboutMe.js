        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a second-year Computer Science student from Romania with a passion
          for coding. Over the years, I've developed a range of applications and
          programs using different languages and frameworks. While most of my
          work is on display on GitHub, there are still a few projects in the
          pipeline. I'm eager to take on new challenges and opportunities, keen
          to expand my knowledge and collaborate with people globally on
          creating efficient and accessible software.
